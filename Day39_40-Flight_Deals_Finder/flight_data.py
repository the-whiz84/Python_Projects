    Parses flight data received from the Amadeus API to identify the cheapest flight option among

        FlightData: An instance of the FlightData class representing the cheapest flight found,

    This function initially checks if the data contains valid flight entries. If no valid data is found,
    it returns a FlightData object containing "N/A" for all fields. Otherwise, it starts by assuming the first
    flight in the list is the cheapest. It then iterates through all available flights in the data, updating
     the cheapest flight details whenever a lower-priced flight is encountered. The result is a populated
     FlightData object with the details of the most affordable flight.
