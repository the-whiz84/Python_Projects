# Day 92 - Color Extractor Website

This lesson is manually reconstructed from this day’s real project files. It focuses specifically on **Color Extractor Website** and avoids generic cross-day boilerplate.

## 1. What You Build

You build **Color Extractor Website** as a day-specific project using `flask`.
Primary entrypoint: `main.py`.

## 2. Core Concepts

- Day-specific stack and techniques: `flask`.
- Converting raw inputs/events/data into deterministic outputs.
- Organizing logic so the main flow stays readable and debuggable.

## 3. Project Structure

- `main.py`: Entrypoint script coordinating the full flow.
- `requirements.txt`: Project resource used by this day.

## 4. Implementation Walkthrough

1. Define route handlers and keep request parsing separate from rendering logic.
2. Add targeted checks for edge cases and invalid paths before final output.
3. Add targeted checks for edge cases and invalid paths before final output.

## 5. Day Code Snippet

Excerpt from `main.py`:
```python
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["UPLOAD_FOLDER"] = "static/uploads"
app.config["ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS"] = {"png", "jpg", "jpeg"}
Bootstrap5(app)


def allowed_file(filename):
    return (
        "." in filename
        and filename.rsplit(".", 1)[1].lower() in app.config["ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS"]
    )


def extract_colors(image_path, num_colors=10):
```

## 6. How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
python "main.py"
```

## 7. Common Pitfalls and Debug Tips

- Route and template variable mismatches are common; verify context keys end-to-end.
- Reproduce failures with the smallest input first, then expand once stable.

## 8. Practice Extensions

- Add one improvement that increases reliability (validation, retries, or explicit error handling).
- Add one improvement that increases maintainability (refactor repeated logic into helpers/services).
- Add one improvement that increases usability (clearer output, better UI feedback, or richer docs).

## 9. Key Takeaways

- **Color Extractor Website** is strongest when the main flow is simple and each helper has one clear job.
- Real project snippets from this day should be your baseline when reviewing or extending the code.
- This lesson was authored directly from day code and project artifacts where no prior lesson file existed.
