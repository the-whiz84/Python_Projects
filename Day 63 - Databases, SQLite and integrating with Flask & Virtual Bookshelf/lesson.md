# Day 63 - Databases, SQLite and integrating with Flask & Virtual Bookshelf

This lesson is manually reconstructed from this day’s real project files and historical lesson notes from git history. It focuses specifically on **Databases, SQLite and integrating with Flask & Virtual Bookshelf** and avoids generic cross-day boilerplate.

## 1. What You Build

You build **Databases, SQLite and integrating with Flask & Virtual Bookshelf** as a day-specific project using `flask`, `sqlalchemy`.
Primary entrypoint: `main.py`.

## 2. Core Concepts

- Day-specific stack and techniques: `flask`, `sqlalchemy`.
- Converting raw inputs/events/data into deterministic outputs.
- Organizing logic so the main flow stays readable and debuggable.

Historical lesson signals recovered from git history:
- We can see that our list of books is lost when we stop the program as it is saved in a list.
- I. SQLite Databases
- First, let's create a database. The most used database in the world is SQLite.

## 3. Project Structure

- `main.py`: Entrypoint script coordinating the full flow.
- `requirements.txt`: Project resource used by this day.

## 4. Implementation Walkthrough

1. Define route handlers and keep request parsing separate from rendering logic.
2. Add targeted checks for edge cases and invalid paths before final output.
3. Add targeted checks for edge cases and invalid paths before final output.

## 5. Day Code Snippet

Excerpt from `main.py`:
```python
'''
Red underlines? Install the required packages first: 
Open the Terminal in PyCharm (bottom left). 

On Windows type:
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

On MacOS type:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

This will install the packages from requirements.txt for this project.
'''

app = Flask(__name__)
```

## 6. How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
python "main.py"
```

## 7. Common Pitfalls and Debug Tips

- Route and template variable mismatches are common; verify context keys end-to-end.
- Reproduce failures with the smallest input first, then expand once stable.

## 8. Practice Extensions

- Add one improvement that increases reliability (validation, retries, or explicit error handling).
- Add one improvement that increases maintainability (refactor repeated logic into helpers/services).
- Add one improvement that increases usability (clearer output, better UI feedback, or richer docs).

## 9. Key Takeaways

- **Databases, SQLite and integrating with Flask & Virtual Bookshelf** is strongest when the main flow is simple and each helper has one clear job.
- Real project snippets from this day should be your baseline when reviewing or extending the code.
- Historical lesson notes were preserved and translated into the new structure for continuity.
