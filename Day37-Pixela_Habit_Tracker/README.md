# Description
This is an application that uses the APIs from Pixela (https://pixe.la) to create a Habit Tracker using only HTTP requests.
I have upgraded the solution in the lesson with an UI using tkinter and assigning the HTTP requests to each button.

# How to use
- create a free account on Pixela
- using their documentation, create a username and generate your own API token using HTTP post requests
- once you have your graph created, modify the variables with your own data
- you can also modify the labels or title to your own tracker and units (from hours to km for running or cycling for example)
- save your Token as environment variable for security (see previous days for instructions)
- run the program and manage your tracker using the UI

# Disclaimer
On MacOS Sonoma, if you have dark mode on, the calendar looks very dark and I cannot change the background color no matter what I tried.
On light mode, it looks ok, don't know how it will look in Windows and Linux.
