# Description

This is the fourth project without any guidance from the last Chapter of the Course: Porfolio Projects.

## How to use
- install required packages with Anaconda or Pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- just run main.py in your IDE or in a terminal type `python3 main.py`


## Notes
There are 2 versions of the `word_list` in word_list.py. One has words that form sentences and one has just 100 random words. You can comment the one you don't want.
