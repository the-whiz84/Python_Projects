# Description
In this chapter we use Plotly to draw charts from Google Play Store data analysis.

# How to use
- in VsCode install extension Jupyter from Microsoft or use the csv file online in Google Drive - Add New File - Google Collaboration (https://colab.research.google.com)
- install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- for VsCode you need to select an interpreter first for Python (either .venv or the path to your Python installation)
- you can run each code cell individually with SHIFT + ENTER or by clicking Run All on top of the Notebook file.
