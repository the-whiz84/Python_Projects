# Day 99 - Space Missions Data Analysis

This lesson is manually reconstructed from this day’s real project files. It focuses specifically on **Space Missions Data Analysis** and avoids generic cross-day boilerplate.

## 1. What You Build

You build **Space Missions Data Analysis** as a day-specific project using `notebook`.
Primary entrypoint: `Space_Missions_Analysis.ipynb`.

## 2. Core Concepts

- Day-specific stack and techniques: `notebook`.
- Converting raw inputs/events/data into deterministic outputs.
- Organizing logic so the main flow stays readable and debuggable.

## 3. Project Structure

- `Space_Missions_Analysis.ipynb`: Primary analysis notebook.
- `mission_launches.csv`: Dataset/input data consumed by the day project.
- `mission_launches_Feb2024.csv`: Dataset/input data consumed by the day project.

## 4. Implementation Walkthrough

1. Run notebook cells in order to preserve variable state and reproducible results.
2. Inspect and clean data before plotting or statistical interpretation.
3. Document conclusions directly beside code so insights remain auditable.

## 5. Day Code Snippet

Excerpt from `Space_Missions_Analysis.ipynb`:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# These might be helpful:
from iso3166 import countries
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```

## 6. How to Run

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 7. Common Pitfalls and Debug Tips

- Check nulls and dtypes before aggregations or charts to avoid misleading results.
- Reproduce failures with the smallest input first, then expand once stable.

## 8. Practice Extensions

- Add one improvement that increases reliability (validation, retries, or explicit error handling).
- Add one improvement that increases maintainability (refactor repeated logic into helpers/services).
- Add one improvement that increases usability (clearer output, better UI feedback, or richer docs).

## 9. Key Takeaways

- **Space Missions Data Analysis** is strongest when the main flow is simple and each helper has one clear job.
- Real project snippets from this day should be your baseline when reviewing or extending the code.
- This lesson was authored directly from day code and project artifacts where no prior lesson file existed.
