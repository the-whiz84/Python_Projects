# 🐍 Python 100 Days of Code: The Complete Bootcamp

Welcome to my personal journey through Dr. Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). This repository contains a collection of projects, scripts, and applications developed over 100 days of intensive learning.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

This repository covers a wide range of Python applications:
- **Web Development**: Flask, Bootstrap, RESTful APIs, and User Authentication.
- **Data Science & Visualization**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and NumPy.
- **Automation & Web Scraping**: Beautiful Soup, Selenium, and API-driven automation.
- **GUIs & Games**: Tkinter, Turtle, and classic games like Pong and Snake.
- **Professional Skills**: OOP, Version Control (Git), and Exception Handling.

## 📂 Project Structure

Folders are organized chronologically and by topic:
- `Day 01 - 14`: Python Foundations (CLI tools, logic, and base syntax).
- `Day 15 - 31`: Intermediate GUI and OOP (Games and Desktop apps).
- `Day 32 - 40`: Intermediate+ Web APIs and JSON handling.
- `Day 41 - 58`: Web Development Fundamentals (HTML, CSS, Flask).
- `Day 59 - 71`: Advanced Web Development (Databases, REST, Auth).
- `Day 72 - 81`: Data Science and Professional Analysis.
- `Day 82 - 100`: Capstone Projects and Advanced Automation.

## 📝 Learning Journey Notes

- **Multi-OS Development**: Started on Linux (Fedora), transitioned to MacOS from Day 15.
- **IDE Evolution**: Utilized both VS Code and PyCharm throughout the course.
- **Consolidated Progress**: Multi-part projects have been merged into single "Day" folders for better organization.
