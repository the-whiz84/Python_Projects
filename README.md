# Python_Projects
Repo for my Python Projects created during the 100 Days of Code course on Udemy
https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

They were created in VS Code running on Linux (Fedora 35).

Some of these projects were also created on Replit

# Installation Guide

1. You will need Python installed in order to run the .py files. 
You can get the latest version for all OS versions from here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. You then need either a text editor or IDE to run them or play around with the code.
I use VS Code but you can use either PyCharm, VIM or your favorite one.

3. In Linux you can also run them directly from the Terminal by launching them with Python:
`/bin/python /path-to-file/main.py`.
On some distros you might need to type:
`python3 /path-to-file/main.py`
