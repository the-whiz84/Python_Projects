# Installation Guide

1. You will need Python installed in order to run the .py files. 
You can get the latest version for all OS versions from here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. You then need either a text editor or IDE to run them or play around with the code.
I use VS Code but you can use either PyCharm, VIM or your favorite one.

3. In Linux you can also run them directly from the Terminal by launching them with Python:
/bin/python /path-to-file/main.py
