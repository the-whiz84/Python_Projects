# Python_Projects

Repo for my Python Projects created during the **100 Days of Code** course on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/">Udemy.</a>

They were initially created in VS Code running on Linux (Fedora 35). 
From Day 15, I switched to MacOS and also used PyCharm for the first 30 Days.

## Installation Guide

1. You will need Python installed in order to run the `.py` files. 
You can get the latest version for all OS versions from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>.

2. You then need either a text editor or IDE to run them or play around with the code.
I use VS Code but you can use either PyCharm, VIM or your favorite one.

3. In Linux or MacOS you can also run them directly from the Terminal by launching them with Python:
`/bin/python /path-to-file/main.py`. On some distros you might need to type: `python3 /path-to-file/main.py`

## Module Requirements

Some of the projects use modules that don't come preinstalled with Python. 
You can install them by running `pip install module-name` in the terminal or manage them with Anaconda.

### Notes
Some days are not included either because they had no projects or because the projects cannot be done in 2024 due to changes to the websites involved in web-scrapping.
Larger projects were also moved to separate repositories, like <a href='https://github.com/the-whiz84/Capstone_Blog_Project'>Capstone Blog Website</a> and <a href='https://github.com/the-whiz84/Flask-ToDo-App'>ToDo App Website</a>.

In the second part of the course, I added **README** files in each folder in Markdown format with additional instructions.
