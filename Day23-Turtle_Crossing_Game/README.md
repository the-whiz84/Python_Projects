Do you remember the game Frogger? 
Play my version of it made in Python with the Turtle module.
##
# Instructions:
1. You can move the turtle Up, Left and Right using the arrow keys, but not Down
2. Each time you cross the finish line at the top, the Level increases and the cars go faster

See how high you can go before a car hits the frog and is Game Over.
