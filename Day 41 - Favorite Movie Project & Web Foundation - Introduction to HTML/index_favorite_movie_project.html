 <h2>Top 10 best movies I've watched</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
 <p>
    This is the only movie I can gladly re-watch anytime. <br />
    One of the classic movies that everyone should watch at least once.<br />
 </p>

 <h3>The Matrix</h3>
 <p>
    One of the best sci-fi movies ever made. The first is still the best of the quadrilogy.
 </p>

 <h3>Blade Runner</h3>
 <p>
    A cult classic and the movie that made cyberpunk what it is now. <br />
    It inspired countless themes in movies, tv and games.
 </p>

 <h3>Alien</h3>
 <p>
    For fans of sci-fi and/or horror movies, this is a must see.<br />
    The sequel, Aliens, is also pretty good.
 </p>

 <h3>Terminator 2</h3>
 <p>
    Although this is the second in the franchise, the first one does not hold up as good as T2.
 </p>

 <h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
 <p>
    Although there are many sequels, the original one is still, in my opinion, the greatest dinosaur movie.
 </p>

 <h3>Predator</h3>
 <p>
    Together with Alien, they created an entire universe and multiple franchises and crossovers.<br />
    After Terminator 2, this is Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role.
 </p>

 <h3>The Lord of the Rings trilogy</h3>
 <p>
    I can't say that one of them is better than the others, the entire trilogy is a must-see.<br />
    I recommend you get the extended editions and watch all 3 of them.
 </p>

 <h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
    One of the most thought provoking sci-fi movies ever.
</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>If you haven't seen this movie, wth are you doing with your free time?!</p>
