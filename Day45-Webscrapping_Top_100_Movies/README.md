# Description
This is a project that scrapes the data from Empire's website of Top 100 Movies of all time (https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/best-movies-2/) to parse the HTML code and generate a txt file with the top 100 movies.

# How to use
- website gets updated regularly to prevent web scrapping so the HTML code was saved to data/100_best_movies.html
- you can rename or move the file and try to get an updated version of the list for your current date
- you then need to inspect the page and see if the list title is the same or has changed and update the code with the new Class name
- run the code and generate your text file
- go through the list and remove the movies you have seen already
