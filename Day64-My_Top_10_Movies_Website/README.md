# Description
This is website that uses all we have learned the previous days about Flask, Bootstrap, WTForms, SQLite and so on to populate a database of movies.
It fetches the movie information and poster picture using the API from https://www.themoviedb.org.

# How to use
- follow the instructions in Day 62 to install packages from requirements.txt
- set up your free account and API Token on TMDB website
- add your token to your environment variables
- I have left the database with my top 10 movies. You can add to it, edit ratings and reviews or delete them and add your own
- you can add a movie by searching for it's title and then selecting from the list of results from the API
- you will then be redirected to add a rating and a review to it to add it to the database
