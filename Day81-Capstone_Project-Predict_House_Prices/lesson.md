# Capstone Project - Predict House Prices


Welcome to Boston Massachusetts in the 1970s! Imagine you're working for a real estate development company. Your company wants to value any residential project before they start. You are tasked with building a model that can provide a price estimate based on a home's characteristics like:

- The number of rooms
- The distance to employment centres
- How rich or poor the area is
- How many students there are per teacher in local schools etc

**Today you will:**

- Analyse and explore the Boston house price data
- Split your data for training and testing
- Run a Multivariable Regression
- Evaluate how your model's coefficients and residuals
- Use data transformation to improve your model performance
- Use your model to estimate a property price


I commented my solution where applicable and added the instructor's solution from the completed project for each line.


**Today you've learned**

- How to quickly spot relationships in a dataset using Seaborn's `.pairplot()`.
- How to split the data into a training and testing dataset to better evaluate a model's performance.
- How to run a multivariable regression.
- How to evaluate that regression-based on the sign of its coefficients.
- How to analyze and look for patterns in a model's residuals.
- How to improve a regression model using (a log) data transformation.
- How to specify your own values for various features and use your model to make a prediction.
