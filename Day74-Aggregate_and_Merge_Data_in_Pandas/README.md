# Description
In this chapter we dive deeper in creating charts in Jupyter Notebook with Matplotlib extension and merging and aggregating data from different DataFrames.

# How to use
- in VsCode install extension Jupyter from Microsoft or use the csv file online in Google Drive - Add New File - Google Collaboration (https://colab.research.google.com)
- for VsCode you need to select an interpreter first for Python (either .venv or the path to your Python installation)
- you can run each code cell individually with SHIFT + ENTER or by clicking Run All on top of the Notebook file.
