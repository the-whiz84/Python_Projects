# Description

This is the third project without any guidance from the last Chapter of the Course: Porfolio Projects.

## How to use
- install required packages with Anaconda or Pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- add your own watermark text or logo in `.png` format
- just run main.py in your IDE or in a terminal type `python3 main.py`
- select the save folder for your processed images
- drag and drop images to the window or use the `Select Image` button
- press `Clear` to remove the preview of the processed image in order to add another file

## Notes
There are 2 versions of the app, one using Tkinter and one using PyQt5. I could not get the Tkinter window to open Finder in MacOS Sequoia, maybe it works in Windows.
