Play the classic Snake game from the old Nokia phones!

# Instructions

Control the snake head direction with the arrow keys.
You cannot switch the snake head direction to the opposite side. For eg, if the snake is moving Up, pressing Down will not do anything.

Each time the Snake eats a turtle, it's size increases and a point is added to the scoreboard.

Game Over occurs when the snake hits the edges of the screen or it's own tail.
When this happens, you can choose to continue playing or to quit and close the window.

High Score is saved and kept between sessions.
