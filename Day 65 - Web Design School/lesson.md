# Web Design Basics

# The 4 pillars of good web design:
- Color Theory
- Typography
- UI (User Interface)
- UX (User Experience)


# I. Understanding Color Theory


# 1. When selecting the color pallette, we need to be aware about the mood the color expresses:
- Red - Love, Energy, Intensity
- Yellow - Joy, Intellect, Attention
- Green - Freshness, Safety, Growth
- Blue - Stability, Trust, Serenity
- Purple - Royalty, Wealth, Feminity


# 2. Combining Colors

The most scientific part of color theory is how to combine colors. Designer will rely on scientific ways to combine them

# Analogous Colors
- combining 2 colors that are next to each other on the color wheel
- good for navigation bars, body or logo

# Complementary colors
- selecting colors from the opposite end of the color wheel 
- makes the design stand out more

# We shouldn't style text and text background using complementary colors as it looks very jarring

# Other ways to combine colors:

- Triadic -  drawing an equilateral triangle on the color wheel
- drawing a square on the color wheel



# II. Understanding Typography and how to choose fonts


# Just like colors, different fonts convey different moods or emotions:
- Serif - Traditional (Minion Pro), Stable (Trojan), Respectable (Baskerville)
- Sans-Serif - Sensible (Helvetica), Simple (Avenir), Straightforward (Din)
- Script - Personal (Freestyle Script), Creative (Adios Script Pro), Elegant (Snell Roundhand)
- Display - Friendly (Vag Rounded), Loud (Gin), Amusing (Thirsty Rough)
- Modern - Stylish (Sackers Gothic), Chic (Gotham), Smart (Futura)


# There are 2 major families of font types:

# 1. Serif typeface - where the columns of letters have feet

 They are divided in subtypes:
 - Old Style        - e.g. Adobe Jenson
 - Transitional     - e.g. Baskerville
 - Modern           - e.g. Didot
 - Slab-Serif       - e.g. American Typewriter

# 2. Sans-Serif - perfect right angles, no feet
https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans

Their subfamilies are:
- Grotesque         - e.g. News Gothic
- Neo-Grotesque     - e.g. Helvetica
- Humanist          - e.g. Gill Sans
- Geometric         - e.g. Futura


# 3. Recommendations:

- Sans Serif are preferred for body text which needs to be more readable
- Using lots of fonts can make a design that is cluttered, overcomplicated and not very nice.
- It is recommended to use 2 fonts in a website design. 
- It is best to combine 2 fonts with similar moods and from the same time era.
- You can contrast the serif-ness: the Heading to be a Serif and the body a Sans or the opposite way
- It is also good to combine the weight of fonts, like bold for headings

# Fonts to avoid:
- Comic Sans
- Kristen
- Papyrus
- Viner
- Curlz
# they are difficult to read and have moods that are hard to fit in the design of a website



# III. Manage Attention with effective User Interface (UI) design


# 1. Hierarchy

# The most important information is conveyed first (who, where, when)

# How to convey hierarchy:

# 1.1 Color
- colors with high contrast with their background are used for high hierarchy
- e.g. of a shopping site that uses mostly white and grey but have a Red link for Shop and a Green Button for Add to Cart

# 1.2. Size
- bigger items draw the eyes to it


# 2. Layout

- big block of text where everything is layed out the same way vs 
- create more interest by inserting pictures, shapes and so on
- the Wikipedia page is an example of bad design cause it looks just like an encyclopedia. Also their text line are very long and hard to keep track of the words.

# There is an optimum line length:
- too long and it gets tedious to read
- too short and it gets choppy and awkward to read
- we must aim for something like 40-60 characters per line
- A good layout is the Grammarly website


# 3. Alignment

- how we position each element on the screen relative to each other
E.G. Title center aligned with text body left aligned vs
title left aligned and body left aligned
# One of the easiest way to make a website look professionally designed is to reduce the number of alignment points


# 4. White Space
- a really important concept in all design
- refers to the empty space the is around the text or elements
- e.g. a luxury bag store vs a boutique one and how the bags are arranged on the shelves. A lot of space is given to each product to underline its importance and sense of luxury


# 5. Audience
- design for your audience ( we can use Comic Sans if we create a website about comic books or children's concert posters)

# IV. User Experience (UX) Design

UX is meant to be invisible but gives the user the sensation of ease of use, of everything working correctly on your website.
# It has 5 components:


# 1. Simplicity
- keeping things simple is always preferred to making it complex or cluttered

vs
https://monocle.com


# 2. Consistency
- keep the design and functionality of your product consistent
- e.g. xfinity.com old website vs new one


# 3. Reading Patterns
- human eyes read  a page from top left then going to the right and then to the next line
- use the F-Layout:
    - logo at top
    - most important parts of your content on the left browsing down the left gutter (bulletpoints, pictures, icons etc)
    - everything follows this pattern
# e.g. commerce websites like Amazon

- another used pattern is the Z-Layout:
    - eyes go from left to right and then diagonally down to the bottom
# e.g. Facebook


# 4. All Platform Design
- all modern websites need to be mobile-responsive
- this can go bad the other way when a website made to look good on mobile/table, looks worse on a desktop/laptop
- a website needs to re-arrange itself when viewed in portrait mobile screen vs wide screen desktop
- avoid too many banners on the mobile version so the content get really small or hidden behind them


# It's important to test the website before going live, even employ professional 3rd party testers


# 5. Don't use your powers for Evil
- professional web designers use human psychology to do bad things, what are called dark patterns
- patterns that tricks the user to perform an action that is detrimental to the user and beneficial to the company behind it
- e.g. clicking on a subscribe button
- e.g. Amazon selecting the Express Delivery option by default when ordering
- e.g. misleading checkboxes
